    <p>As score following and music synchronisation as such are not a new topic or problem that 
        has been solved in our project, let us explain its relevance and focus in the Freisch√ºtz 
        Digital (FreiDi) project. While the FreiDi project site in Erlangen, Germany researched on 
        algorithms for audio synchronisation, the Detmold part of FreiDi worked on their digital music 
        edition. In order to conform to the ideas of a critical archive the synchronisation data gained 
        in Erlangen was incorporated into our MEI encoding, applying the principals of our CoRe-Model. 
        That is to say: the individual MEI files for the recordings capture the synchronization data 
        and link them to mei:measure elements in order to allow identifying which measure is being 
        played at a certain timeslot of the audio. The mei:measures on the other hand reference our 
        CoRE-file and thus allow a connection to the captured scores. This allows access to the 
        digital facsimiles or even the encoded musical content.</p>
