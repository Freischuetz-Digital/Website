    <p>Within the Freischütz Digital project, three numbers (No. 6, 8, and 9) of the opera "Der Freischütz" have been produced by the Erich-Thienhaus-Institute (HfM Detmold). The main purpose for the recording sessions was to produce royalty free audio material that can be used for demonstration and research purposes. The recording was carried out by the Tonmeister students Stefan Antonin (No. 6), Florian Bitzer (No. 8), and Matthias Kieslich (No. 9) under the supervision of Prof. Dipl-Tonm. Bernhard Güttler, and Prof. Dipl-Tonm. Michael Sandner. Besides a professional stereo mix of the three numbers, the dataset provides the raw multitrack recordings from the individual microphones as well as individual group mixes that emphasize different voices or instrument sections.</p>
